# LMNC-drone-oscillator

My own take on Look Mum No Computer's reverse avalanche oscillator, as featured in his 100 oscillator drone video. Four oscillators in a eurorack format, with a buffered output.

Note: This is purely theoretical and hasn't been tested. If you build it and it doesn't work, best find the issue and submit a pull request!
